        <dd>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most
             basic building block of the Web. It defines 
             the meaning and structure of web content. Other
              technologies besides HTML are generally used to 
            describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS)
             or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</dd><br>

                A Java project is a small or large-scale programming
                 endeavour for achieving a specific purpose, such as
                 automating repetitive tasks, testing functionality 
                 and creating recreational or informative applications.
                 Examples of Java projects include digital clocks,
                 interactive websites and mobile games. You can create
                 Java projects in Java with the help of different Java
                 developer tools.
                 These tools are known as integrated development environment (IDE) tools,
                  and they make a Java project by organising various Java files.
                 These are mostly Java source code class files, with a .java extension.

             Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
             Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
             significant indentation.Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.
             It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured
             (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
             It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its 
             comprehensive standard library

             <dt><b>SQL :-</b></dt>
             <dd>
                Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing
                 and processing information in a relational database. A relational
                 database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns
                  representing different data attributes and the various relationships
                 between the data values. You can use SQL statements to store, update,
                 remove, search, and retrieve information from the database. You can also
                  use SQL to maintain and optimize database performance.

                JavaScript (JS) is the most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled
                 programming language. It can be used for both Client-side as well as
                 Server-side developments. JavaScript also known as a scripting language
                  for web pages.
